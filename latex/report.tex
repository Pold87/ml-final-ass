% THE REPORT

% In addition to participating in the competition, we expect you to provide us with a report on your work that at least contains the following :

% - A clear description of the complete and, possibly, best-performing method you implemented;

% - Clear arguments for the different choices you made in compiling your classifier;

% - Sufficient experimental results, learning curves, error bars, or whatever else you need to convince the reader that little improvement will be possible beyond the system that you present;

% - Any references that have been used.


\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}


Therefore, this competition involves three main challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of missing data points
\item Mixture of categorical and continuous variables
\item Classification of the output variable
\end{itemize}

We will address each of them in turn.

\section{Missing data values}

Missing data values are a common problem in machine learning
problems. The failure of sensors, or the conscious loss  due to
anonymity impede the machine learning accuracy. While the \emph{imputation}
of these missing data is still a open problem, several method have
been put forth.
