\subsection{Transductive Learning}

Since the test data is known at the time of the classifier training, this information can be used for using semi-supervised methods with the potential to better capture the underlying distribution. In a first step, ``naive" self-learning was used to incorporate the unlabeled data of the testset. This was done in an iterative approach: In the first iteration, the unlabeled data was labeled by predicting their labels using the training dataset. In the next iteration. The approach did not significantly improve the classification performance. 

The second approach used an implementation based on \texttt{scikit-learn} and the Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood Estimation (CPLE) (\url{https://github.com/tmadl/semisup-learn}).
