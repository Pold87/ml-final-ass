The confusion matrix shows an interesting observation: while the overall accuracy is rather good, the sensitivity is very low: only marginally more than half of the actual wealthy samples are correctly classified as such, while almost all non-wealthy samples are correctly classified as such. The confusion matrix implies that the classifier is ``conservative'' and rather classifies a sample as non-wealthy.
