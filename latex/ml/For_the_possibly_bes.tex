For using an off-the-self imputation technique the data should ideally be Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)---there is no dependence structure between the missing data and any values. Little's MCAR test~\cite{little1988test} is a statistical test with the null hypothesis that the data are MCAR. I used it at the significance level $\alpha=0.05$ to analyze the interaction structure of the variables. The statistic was not significant for the training set with $\chi^2 = 15788.45$ ($p = 0.198, df=15639$).  However, the test statistic was significant for the test set $\chi^2 = 25908.04$ ($p < 0.001, df = 24887$). Therefore, there is evidence that the missing values in the training set are not MCAR.
