Support vector machines build a $D-1$-dimensional hyperplane that
tries to maximize the margin between the two classes. The support
vectors are the samples on the margin for the positive class and the
negative class. The maximum-margin hyperplane is the hyperplane
``right in the middle'' between the support vectors.
