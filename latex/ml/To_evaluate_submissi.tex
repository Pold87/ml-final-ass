To evaluate submissions and determine the ranks of participants, the
Kaggle challenge used the 0-1 loss. While the score on the public leaderboard
is the best validation of the methods employed, only one submission
could be submitted per participant and day. In order to evaluate the
used methods more frequently, I implemented a local 5-fold cross-validation. 

TODO: The cross-validation was performed per dataset of the
imputation result, that is, no cross-dataset cross-validation was
performed. Therefore, in the case of five imputations, 25
cross-validation results were obtained.
