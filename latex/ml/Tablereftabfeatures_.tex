In total, 13 features are given, of which 8 are categorical and 5 continuous (Table~\ref{tab:features}).
%shows the discrete and continuous features.
The training set consists of 10500 samples and the test set has 38342 samples, resulting in a ratio of approximately $1:3.7$.
The test set is thus considerably larger than the training set.
%and generalization performance is particularly important.
Since transductive learning is permitted, the information in the test set---information about the distribution of the variables---could help to increase the classification performance.
