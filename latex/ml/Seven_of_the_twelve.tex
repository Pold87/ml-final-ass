Seven of the twelve measured variables are qualitative (workclass,
education, marital status, occupation, relationship, sex, native
country)---they are measured only at the nominal level. Since
measurements on the nominal level do not allow for a particular
ordering, a proxy method has to be used. To this end, I defined dummy
variables that take the value 0 or 1 to indicate if a certain
category is present. Defining $N$ dummy variables for the $N$
different possible values of a categorical feature allows for
capturing the full information in the orginal unmodified dataset and for using qualitative data in a straight-forward manner.

Transforming the dataset greatly increased its size from 13 to 104 predictor variables.
