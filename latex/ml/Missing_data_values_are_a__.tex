Missing data values are a common problem in statistics. The failure of
sensors, or the concealment of data impede machine learning
accuracy. Thus, methods have been put forth for the imputation of
missing data points, such as case deletion or single mean
imputation~\cite{schafer2002missing}. However, such simple methods
often discard useful information and are are likely to give a rather
poor result if a large part
of the data is missing.
