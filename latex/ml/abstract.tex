This report presents the techniques and results of a classification
  problem involving missing data as well as a mixture of categorical
  and continuous data. The problem of missing data points is
  addressed by Multiple Imputation Chained Equations. The
  classification is conducted using an ensemble of several classifiers. The
  method was evaluated locally using cross-validation and
  remotely on a hold-out test-set using the Kaggle platform. The best
  Kaggle submission resulted in an accuracy of $85.494\,\%$, which corresponds to
the $3^{\text{rd}}$ position out of $23$ participants in the competition.
