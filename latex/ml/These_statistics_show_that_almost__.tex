These statistics show that almost all non-wealthy samples are correctly classified, while only slightly more than half of the wealthy samples are correctly classified. The confusion matrix implies that the classifier is ``conservative'': it avoids classifying samples as wealthy. The high overall accuracy is mainly caused by correctly classifying non-wealthy samples. I tried to make the classifier less conservative by predicting probabilities of the target values and modifying the threshold $\theta$, in the ranges $0.3 - 0.5$. This improved the sensitivity, but, in turn, led to a reduced specificity, thus not improving the classification accuracy in the local cross-validation.
