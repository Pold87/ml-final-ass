Since the relative frequency of missing data points is large in the provided dataset,
simple methods for handling missing data, like listwise deletion or mean imputation . Therefore, data points were imputed using a technique called
Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations
(MICE)~\cite{buuren2011mice} using the \texttt{R} package
\texttt{mice} (Version~2.25). The algorithm uses multiple imputations,
which allows for incorporating the statistical uncertainty in the
imputed values. It is a flexible approach that can also handle
continuous and categorical variables. The general idea is to statistically model the
conditional probability of each missing variable given the remaining
variables.
