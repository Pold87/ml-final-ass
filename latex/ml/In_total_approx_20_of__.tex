In total, approx. $20\,\%$ of the data values are missing, with approx. $23\,\%$ for the variables workclass and occupation, $20\,\%$ for country of origin, and $19\,\%$ for the remaining variables. There is no apparent difference in the percentage and pattern of missing data between the training and the testset. Only $6\,\%$ of samples in the training set and in the test set are complete cases (i.e., have no missing values), making handling missing data a crucial step. I assume that the higher values for the variables workclass, occupation, and country stem from missing values in the original dataset and the missing values for the remaining variables were just introduced.
